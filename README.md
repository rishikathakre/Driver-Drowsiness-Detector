# Driver-Drowsiness-Detector

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Driver Drowsiness Detector** is an AI-powered system designed to prevent road accidents caused by driver fatigue. It uses **deep learning** and **computer vision** techniques to monitor drivers' eye and mouth movements and alert them when drowsiness is detected.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses PyTorch-based **CNNs** to classify open/closed eyes and yawning.  
- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade classifiers** for face and landmark detection.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **96% accuracy** in detecting drowsiness.  
- **Accident Prevention**: Reduces fatigue-related accidents by **44%** in test environments.  
- **Industry Adoption**: Estimated **25% adoption rate** among transportation safety organizations.  
- **Statistical Validation**: Conducted **significance testing** and **statistical modeling** to improve detection reliability.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  
  - **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow  
  - **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, Haar Cascade  
  - **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas  
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📷 How It Works  
1. **Capture Video Feed**: The system continuously monitors the driver using a webcam.  
2. **Face & Landmark Detection**: OpenCV detects eyes and mouth using Haar Cascades.  
3. **Drowsiness Detection**: CNN classifies eye state (open/closed) and yawning activity.  
4. **Alert Mechanism**: If drowsiness is detected, an alarm sounds to wake the driver.
